ResourceDemo
============

a short demo of my resource managment lib [DarwinsBox/resourcehandling](https://github.com/Danny02/DarwinsBox/tree/master/ResourceHandling)

Run the build jar or call `mvn exec:java` to see the example application.
When the app is running edit the [image](src/main/resources/logo3.png) and you
should see the [app](src/main/java/de/darwin/resourcedemo/App.java) display the new version immediately.

Take a look at DarwinsBox's [wiki](https://github.com/Danny02/DarwinsBox/wiki/Resource-Injection) for a more indepth view on how resource injection works.
